                    <h3>From start to finish, how long does it take to build and launch the website?</h3>
                    <p class="font-bold">I make sure I underpromise and overdelive. I set a 8 week deadline for the project.</p>
                    <p>The part of designing the website that usually takes the most time is getting all the necessary stuff from you, like content, pictures and other items.</p>
                    <p>If you're able to get back to me quickly, we might be able to finish the project faster than the estimated 8 weeks.</p>
                    <p>But usually, it takes about 8 weeks to launch the website.</p>

                    <h3>How do we communicate throughout the website build?</h3>
                    <p class="font-bold">I like to provide status updates on a weekly cadence.</p>
                    <p>As I work on the website, I might need to ask yo some questions or get some more information to make sure I'm accurately you business and what you offer.</p>
                    <p>I'll probably send you an email or text to get this info, or to clarify anything I'm not sure about.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold">Of course, you can also text/call/email me during business hours any time you'd like.</p>

                    <h3>What if I don't like the website?</h3>
                    <p>I've never had anyone not like the webite I've made for them.</p>
                    <p>That doesn't happen because of the way I build websites.</p>
                    <p>The first major step of the process is for you to choose your design.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold">You will see exactly what your finished website will look like befor I even start adding your colour scheme, branding, and content.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
                    <h3>How do I pay for the website?</h3>
                    <p>Ideally, you'd pay 100% of the price upfront.</p>
                    <p>This way we can just get everything doneand out of the way, and then, once you give me the go-ahead, I can launch the website without needing anymore money from you.</p>
                    <p>I do off the option to pay 50% down and 50% after it's complete.</p>
                    <p>However, with this option, the last 50% has to be paid before I will launch the site live.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
                    <h3>Who hosts the website?</h3>
                    <p>The website is hosted on Siteground Premium Hosting Technologies.</p>
                    <p>From Siteground's website:</p>
                    <p>"Our platform is built for performance on top of Google Cloud infrastructure with multiple custom speed optimizations."</p>
                    <p>Our Siteground servers are regularly monitored for unauthorised access and auditing.</p>
                    <p>Your website also benefits from two tier 1 CDNs (Content Delevery Network), so it's guarenteed to load ultr-fast all over the world.</p>
                    <p>Siteground has an avery of 100% uptime and I've hosted many many sites with them for years and I have never had any downtime or any other issues.</p>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
                    <h3>What if I don't want to manage the website at all. Can you do it all for me?</h3>
                    <p>We can set you up with a website maintenance package. The minimum monthly retainer is 200 €.</p>
                    <p>We'' set up a monthly retainer which essentially put me on your "payroll" so to speak and you can text/email/call me with any updates you want to make.</p>
                    <p>I can usually get most updates completed and live within 48 hours during business days.</p>
                    <p>We can discuss this during our meetings and determin a monthly retainer that will work for your needs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
                    <h3>Can I update the website myself once it's been built.</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Any text and images you see on the site, you can update without needing me.</p>
                    <p>After the site is launched, I will show you how to update the site if you'd like. It's pretty easy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
                    <h3>Will you write the content for me?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I can write the content for you.</p>
                    <p>I have personal relationships with content writers who produce excellent writing and are affordable.</p>
                    <p>Content writing falls outside the scope of the website design invoice.</p>
                    <p>So it will be a separate project with its own invoice depending on the project scope.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Do you off SEO services?</h3>
                    <p>I do SEO for a big software company as my day job, so I can definitely help you with your SEO needs.</p>
                    <p>If you're interested in SEO, we can discuss it further.</p>
                    <p>SEO services fall outside the scope of the website design invoice.</p>
                    <p>So it will be a separate project with its own invoice depending on the project scope.</p>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
                    <h3>How much does SEO cost?</h3>
                    <p>It is usually a monthly retainer depending on the scope of the project.</p>
                    <p>There is no easy answer but to give a general range, the minimum SEO budget to produce results should be at least 1,000 € per month.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="border border-gray-300 rounded px-8 pt-4 pb-8">
